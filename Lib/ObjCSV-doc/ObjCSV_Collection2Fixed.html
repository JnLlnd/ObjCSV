<h3>Parameters</h4>
<table class="info">
<tr>
  <td width="15%">objCollection</td>
  <td width="85%">Object containing an array of objects (or collection). Objects in the collection are associative arrays which contain a list key-value pairs. See ObjCSV_CSV2Collection returned value for details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="15%">strFilePath</td>
  <td width="85%">The name of the fixed-width destination file, which is assumed to be in %A_WorkingDir% if an absolute path isn't specified.</td>
</tr>

  <td width="15%">strWidth</td>
  <td width="85%">Width for each field. Each numeric values must be in the same order as strFieldOrder and separated by the strFieldDelimiter character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="15%">blnHeader</td>
  <td width="85%">(Optional) If true, the field names in the collection objects are inserted as header of the file, padded or truncated according to each field's width. NOTE: If field names are longer than their fixed-width they will be truncated as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="15%">strFieldOrder</td>
  <td width="85%">(Optional) List of field to include in the file and the order of these fields in the file. Fields names must be separated by the strFieldDelimiter character and, if required, encapsulated by the strEncapsulator character. If empty, all fields are included. Empty by default.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td width="15%">strFieldDelimiter</td>
  <td width="85%">(Optional) Delimiter inserted between fields names in the strFieldOrder parameter and fields width in the strWidth parameter. This delimiter is NOT used in the file data. One character, usually comma, tab or semi-colon. You can choose other delimiters like pipe (|), space, etc. Comma by default. NOTE: End of line characters (<code>n or </code>r) are prohibited as field separator since they are used as record delimiters.</td>

  <td width="15%">strEncapsulator</td>
  <td width="85%">(Optional) One character (usualy double-quote) inserted in the strFieldOrder parameter to embed field names that include at least one of these special characters: line-breaks, field delimiters or the encapsulator character itself. In this last case, the encapsulator character is doubled in the string. For example: &quot;one &quot;&quot;quoted&quot;&quot; word&quot;. Double-quote by default. This delimiter is NOT used in the file data.</td>

<tr>
  <td width="15%">strEolReplacement</td>
  <td width="85%">(Optional) A fixed-width file should not include end-of-line within data.
