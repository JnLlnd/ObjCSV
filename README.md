======

AutoHotkey_L (AHK) functions to load from CSV files, sort, display and save as CSV collections of records using the Object data type. Files can be read and saved in any delimited format (CSV, semi-colon, tab delimited, single-line or multi-line, etc.). Collections can also be displayed, edited and read in GUI ListView objects.
